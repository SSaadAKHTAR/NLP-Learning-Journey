Maintaining good health requires a balanced lifestyle that includes proper nutrition, regular physical activity, and adequate sleep. Healthy eating involves consuming fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and proteins while avoiding excessive sugar and processed foods.

Physical exercise plays an important role in keeping the body active and reducing the risk of diseases such as diabetes and heart problems. Even simple activities like walking or stretching can improve overall fitness.

Mental health is equally important as physical health. Managing stress, maintaining social connections, and practicing mindfulness can help individuals maintain emotional well being.
